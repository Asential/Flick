"# Flack" 

Hello, I have made the chat site 'Flick' with Blue-Orange Theme.

 User Login - First Page for logged out user.
 Channel - Main page on which all the UI exists.

I have completed the requirements as follows:

    1. Users need to enter a display name before they can use the site. Their display name is linked to all the messages.
    2. User is remembered until they logout, even if they close the page.
    3. Every user can create channels. Channels are case-sensitive. Channels with the same names cannot be created.
    4. Channel list is present on the left-side of the chat box.
    5. Chat box displays all the messages in real-time using SocketIO. Each message has the name of the person sending it, it's content and the timestamp.
    6. Each channel can store only 100 messages.
    7. Sending and recieving messages does not require a page reload as data is loaded dynamically.
    8. The last channel of the user is stored. The user joins the last channel on re-entering the site.
    9. For the personal touch, Users can delete their messages, in real-time.

Here are the details of the files in the project:

    1. user.html deals with the login of the user.
    2. channel.html contains all the information of the users, channels, and messages of the current channel.
    3. index.js contains all the JQuery for sockets.
    4. style.css contains the main css selectors and properties.
    5. login.css contain the login page animations.
    6. chat.css contains the css for chat boxes and channel list.
    7. button.scss contains the scss for the login animation(I used an online converter instead of git bash)

I hope I have met all the requirements for the project!

Thank You
